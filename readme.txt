== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Question: Why does not plugin is working for me?

Answers: Check the following reasons:
You have changed the plugin folder`s name to something other than wp-lightbox-2.

The problem is with your WordPress theme, mangling image display properties. Use another theme, that does not interfere with posted images.

You have other plugins that conflict with Lightbox

Disable your other plugins and see if that helps. If it does, re-enable each plugin, one at a time to see which one is causing the conflict.

Question: It does not work properly in Browser X (Explorer 6, 7, etc)?

Answer: Yes it does. The problem is with your WordPress theme, mangling image display properties. Use another theme, or change your theme`s Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
