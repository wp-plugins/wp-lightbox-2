== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Question: Why does not plugin is working for me?

Answers: Check the following reasons:
You have changed the plugin folder`s name to something other than wp-lightbox-2.

You have other plugins that conflict with Lightbox

Disable your other plugins and see if that helps. If it does, re-enable each plugin, one at a time to see which one is causing the conflict.

Question: It does not work properly in Browser X (Explorer 6, 7, etc)?

Answer: Yes it does. The problem is with your WordPress theme, mangling image display properties. Use another theme, or change your theme`s Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
